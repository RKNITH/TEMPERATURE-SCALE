            <h2>Theory of Temperature</h2>
            <p>Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system. It is an important
                concept in physics and everyday life because it determines the direction of heat transfer. Heat always
                flows from a body at a higher temperature to one at a lower temperature.</p>
            <p>There are three common temperature scales: Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). The Celsius
                scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, which are 0°C and 100°C respectively. The
                Fahrenheit scale sets the freezing point of water at 32°F and the boiling point at 212°F. The Kelvin
                scale, used primarily in scientific contexts, starts at absolute zero, the theoretical point where all
                molecular motion stops, which is 0 K, equivalent to -273.15°C.</p>
            <p>Temperature is a fundamental parameter in thermodynamics, a branch of physics that deals with heat and
                temperature and their relation to energy and work. The laws of thermodynamics describe how energy moves
                and changes form. The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are each in thermal
                equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other, which allows for the
                definition of temperature.</p>

            <h2>Methods to Measure Temperature</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thermometers:</strong> The most common instruments for measuring temperature, thermometers
                    can be liquid-in-glass (mercury or alcohol), digital, or infrared.</li>
                <li><strong>Thermocouples:</strong> These are widely used in industrial applications. A thermocouple
                    consists of two different types of metals joined together at one end. When the junction of the two
                    metals is heated or cooled, it produces a voltage that can be correlated back to temperature.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrared Sensors:</strong> These measure the infrared radiation emitted by an object. They
                    are useful for measuring temperature from a distance, especially in situations where a traditional
                    thermometer cannot be used.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs):</strong> These devices measure temperature by
                    correlating the resistance of the RTD element with temperature. They are known for their accuracy
                    and stability over a wide temperature range.</li>
                <li><strong>Thermistors:</strong> Similar to RTDs, thermistors are temperature-sensitive resistors. They
                    are made from ceramic materials that exhibit a large change in resistance with temperature, making
                    them very sensitive.</li>
                <li><strong>Bimetallic Strips:</strong> Used in some thermostats, these consist of two different metals
                    bonded together that expand at different rates as they are heated. This causes the strip to bend,
                    and this bending can be used to measure temperature or activate switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquid Crystal Temperature Sensors:</strong> These contain liquid crystals that change color
                    based on temperature. They are often used in medical thermometers and other applications where
                    visual temperature indication is useful.</li>
